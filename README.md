# Agita
## TUI for speeding up your git workflow

Instead of continually typing the same commands over and over again repeatedly without end, and then re-typing it because of a tyop, just select the command from a text-based user interface. That's the point of Agita.

But beware, Agita is still very new and rather rough around the edges.
